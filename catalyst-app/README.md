# Catalyst Coach

TypeScript/Electron port of the Python `catalyst_gui` + `garmin/` pipeline.
Pulls Garmin Catalyst session telemetry, loads it into DuckDB, generates
coaching briefs, and shows everything in a React-based desktop UI.

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # launches Vite + Electron
```

## Remote / headless server

Catalyst Coach can serve the complete UI to phones and other computers. Each
driver name gets a separate workspace containing its own DuckDB database, raw
sessions, Garmin token/config, AI coaching history, Garage profiles, track
edits, and settings.

Garage profile Markdown is imported into DuckDB the first time a workspace
opens Garage. From then on, Garage reads and writes the database. The `.md`
files are kept in sync as compatibility mirrors so AI prompt generation and
human-readable backups continue to work; if the telemetry database is rebuilt,
those mirrors seed the Garage tables again.

```bash
npm install
npm run server -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3210 --data-dir /path/on/your/nas/catalyst-coach
```

Then open `http://<server-address>:3210` and enter a driver name. Entering a new
name creates the account; entering the same name on another device opens the
same data. There is intentionally no Catalyst-server password. Garmin sign-in
is separate and is still required before that driver can sync telemetry.

The packaged desktop app starts this server automatically on port 3210. Its
window is a client of the same server, so log into the same driver name on the
desktop and phone to share live sync progress and data.

Environment equivalents are available for unattended services:

```bash
CATALYST_SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0 \
CATALYST_SERVER_PORT=3210 \
CATALYST_SERVER_DATA_DIR=/path/on/your/nas/catalyst-coach \
npm run server:start
```

`server:start` expects `npm run build` to have already been run; `npm run
server` builds first. Keep this passwordless service on a trusted LAN or behind
your own authenticated reverse proxy—do not expose it directly to the public
internet. Back up the configured data directory to preserve every user.

## CLI scripts (run individually without the GUI)

```bash
npm run fetch        # pull all sessions from Garmin
npm run load         # load downloaded JSON+protobuf into DuckDB
npm run corners      # detect corners on a meanline
npm run brief -- --last 5         # generate a coaching brief
```

## Package

```bash
npm run package      # build + electron-builder, output to release/
```

## Data location

By default the app reads from `../garmin/data/` and `../garmin/config.json`
(sibling to the Python project) so the existing data set is reused.
Override with the `CATALYST_DATA_DIR` env var.

## AI Coach providers

Choose Anthropic or OpenAI in **Overview → AI Coach**, select a model, and add
the API key for that provider. Provider keys are saved only in the local
`garmin/config.json` (which is gitignored); no keys are bundled in the app or
source. OpenAI supports Astra (`gpt-6-astra`), Sol (`gpt-5.6-sol`), and Terra
(`gpt-5.6-terra`) through the Responses API with x-high reasoning.
